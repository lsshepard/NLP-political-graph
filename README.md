AI pipeline that extracts political arguments and standpoints using OpenAI's GPT models to construct knowledge graphs. Implements recursive argument generation with parallel processing, semantic node aggregation, and web-based graph visualization. The system processes political documents to build hierarchical structures of topics, standpoints, supporting arguments, facts and fundamental values, utilizing prompt engineering and LLM orchestration techniques.
